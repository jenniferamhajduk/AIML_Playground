# Binomial Expression

- The Binomial Distribution is used in statistics to facilitate determining probabilities when collecting more information would be cost prohibitive or time consuming.

- If we are to use a histogram in order to categorize discrete data, then the Binomial Distribution can help us to fill in the blanks when bins are empty, using mathematical expression.

- The Binomial Distribution is used for determining probabilities discrete distributions using binary outcomes.

- When determining the probabilistic outcomes of events that happen in discrete units of time, use Poisson Distribution.
