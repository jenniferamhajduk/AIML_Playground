# Gradient Descent

- Gradient Descent is used to find the optimal parameter that fit the data to a model. Gradient descent begins wiht a guess and then optimizes until the cost function in minimized.

- When we optimize two parameters using gradient descent, we get a three-dimensional graph of the SSR

- A collection of derivatives of the same function but with respect to different parameters is called a gradient.
