# AIML_Playground
AIML Playground. Some projects are from my masters at UIUC and some are for fun/learning.

## Data Cleaning Project
Machine Problems from my Data Mining Course at UIUC

## Deep Learning Project
My final project for Deep Learning for Healthcare at UIUC

## Deep Learning with PyTorch
Implementation from a course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=72184s

## Experiments
Some naive implementations of vector/matrix math and other things

## Guide to Machine Learning
Implementations from Josh Starmer's Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning book

## Machine Learning Free Code Camp
Implementation from a course in machine learning by Free Code Camp

## Machine Learning Projects
Problems from Applied Machine Learning from UIUC

## NOAA Buoy
Time series predictions based on NOAA buoy infromation from 1980 - 2022

## Petal Width Prediction
A simple machine learning app using Flask\Python. Predict the petal length(s) based on width(s) given. Using the iris dataset from UCI machine learning repository. A fun example.
