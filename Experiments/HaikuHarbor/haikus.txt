Gentle breeze flows through,\n
Whispering leaves tell secrets,\n
Nature's song, so soft.\n\n,

Moonlight bathes the night,\n
Silver glow on tranquil sea,\n
Peace reigns in darkness.\n\n,

City wakes slowly,\n
Sunrise over concrete peaks,\n
Day's first light glimmers.\n\n,

Leaves turn gold and red,\n
Autumn's crisp breath in the air,\n
Seasons shift their dance.\n\n,

Peaks touch the sky's edge,\n
Alone in vast wilderness,\n
Nature's grandeur reigns.\n\n,

Stars twinkle above,\n
In the vast, endless night sky,\n
Dreams sail on moonbeams.\n\n,

Raindrops kiss the earth,\n
A soft, rhythmic melody,\n
Nature's lullaby.\n\n,

Snow blankets the land,\n
White silence, winter's embrace,\n
Nature sleeps in peace.\n\n,

Blossoms greet the sun,\n
Spring whispers through awakening buds,\n
New life in bloom.\n\n,

Sands stretch to the sky,\n
Heat shimmers like ocean waves,\n
Desert's mirage dance.\n\n,

Deep in ocean's heart,\n
Secrets hidden in the blue,\n
Silent world below.\n\n,

Trees stand tall and proud,\n
Whispering ancient secrets,\n
In the forest's heart.\n\n,

Sky ablaze at dusk,\n
Sunset paints the world in fire,\n
Day's spectacular end.\n\n,

Clear stream rushes by,\n
Over stones, through silent woods,\n
Mountain's lifeblood flows.\n\n,

City lights flicker,\n
Night's rhythm in neon beats,\n
Urban heart pulses.\n
